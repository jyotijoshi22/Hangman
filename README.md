# Hangman

MVP
The project is a version of the game Hangman to be played in a Java console application.
The game  randomly select a word from the provided list.
When the word is selected, a row of underscores representing letters in the word are printed to the console.
The user is asked to enter a letter and if the letter entered by the user is in the word, the letter is  revealed, for example
H _ _ _ _
when the user enters "H"

and if the letter is not in the word, a part of the hangman would be printed to the console, for example:
___|___

The user is able to guess wrong 7 times before they loose.
